# Page Turner App

## Intended Functionality
This is intended to be a FOSS app that works similarly to Yousician and Musescore.
Users should be able to compose sheet music in the app with very little effort.
Users should be able to play music in time with the app acting as a moving reader.
Users should be able to adjust tempo and select specific parts of the song.
Piano users should be able to play one hand at a time.
Music should be stored using an open standard that makes it as accessible as possible.

## Potential Functionality
Users can play an instrument and the sheet music can be constructed by sound within certain tolerences.
Synchronize apps between users to allow bands to play together in correct time.
Allow one user (the conductor) to set tempo, and have overall control of all the apps.
